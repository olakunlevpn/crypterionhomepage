  <p>This Cookie Policy explains how {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} and its group companies
  ("{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}", "we", "us" and "our") use cookies and similar technologies
  when you visit our websites located at <a href="https://{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}.com">{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}.com</a> or any
  other websites, pages, features, or content we own or operate
  (collectively, the "Site(s)"), when you use the {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} mobile app,
  and/or interact with {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} online advertisements or marketing emails
  (collectively the "Services"). It explains what these technologies are
  and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

  <p>In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect
  personal information, or information that becomes personal information
  if we combine it with other information. In such cases the <a href="https://{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}.com/page/privacy">{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}
  Privacy Policy</a> or the <a href="https://{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}.com/page/privacy">{{ ucwords($data['name']) }} International Privacy Policy</a> will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other

  <h3 id="what-are-cookies">WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>

  <p>Cookies are small files, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded
  onto your computer or mobile device when you visit certain websites.
  When you return to these websites, or visit other websites that use the
  same cookies, the websites recognize these cookies and your browsing
  device. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie
  files created by other websites.</p>

  <p>Cookies set by the website operator are called "first party cookies".
  Cookies set by parties other than the website operator are called "third
  party cookies". The parties that set third party cookies can recognize
  your computer both when it visits the {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} website and when it
  visits certain other websites and/or mobile apps.</p>

  <p>We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as
  none‚ personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or
  similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we
  also treat these identifiers as personal information. If we combine
  non-personal information with personal information, the combined
  information will be treated as personal information for as long as it
  remains combined.</p>

  <p>More information on cookies and their use can be found at
  <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">www.aboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="why-do-we-use-cookies">WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?</h3>

  <p>When you access our Services, we or companies we work with may place
  cookies on your computer or other device. These technologies help us
  better understand user behavior, and inform us about which parts of our
  websites people have visited.</p>

  <p>We use first party and third party cookies to recognize you as a
  {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} customer, customize {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} Services, content, and
  advertising, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to collect
  information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk,
  help prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety.</p>

  <p>We may place cookies from third-party service providers who may use
  information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements
  for products and services available from {{ ucwords($data['name']) }}. We do not control the
  types of information collected and stored by these third-party cookies.
  You should check the third-party's website for more information on how
  they use cookies.</p>

  <p>The following are some examples of non-personal information that we
  collect and how we may use it:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>We may collect and store details of how you use our Services. Except
  in limited instances to ensure quality of our Services over the
  Internet, such information will not be associated with your
  IP address.</p></li>
  <li><p>We may collect information such as your language, zip code, area
  code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time
  zone so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve
  our Services.</p></li>
  <li><p>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our
  website, which is used to understand which parts of our Sites and
  Services are of most interest. This data is aggregated, and thus is
  considered non‚Äëpersonal information for the purposes of this
  Privacy Policy.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="what-types-of-cookies-do-we-use">WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</h3>

  <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>  <strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
  <p>These cookies are essential because they enable you to move around our
  Services and use certain features on our Services. For example,
  strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas. Without
  these cookies, some Services cannot be provided.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
  <li>  <strong>Performance/Analytics Cookies</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
  <p>These cookies collect information about how you use a website. For
  example, a performance/analytics cookie will collect information about
  which pages you go to most often, how much time you spend on that
  page, or if you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies
  do not gather information that identifies you. The information these
  cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our
  Services work.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
  <li>  <strong>Functionality Cookies</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
  <p>These cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor
  our Services so we can provide relevant content to you. For example, a
  functionality cookie can remember your preferences (e.g., country or
  language selection), or your username. Session Cookies. We use session
  cookies when you access our website or content. Session cookies expire
  and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or
  close your browser.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3 id="how-long-will-cookies-stay-on-my-browsing-device">HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?</h3>

  <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on
  whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will
  only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies
  stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted (i.e.
  after you have finished browsing).</p>

  <h3 id="what-other-similar-technologies-does-{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}-use">WHAT OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DOES {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} USE?</h3>

  <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies, like web
  beacons to track users of our Services. Web beacons, or "clear gifs,"
  are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
  cookies. They are used to track the online movements of web users.</p>

  <p>In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive
  or device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about
  the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We and our
  third-party service provider employ web beacons for the reasons stated
  above (under "Cookies"), but primarily to help us better manage content
  on our Services by informing us which content is effective.</p>

  <p>We may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as "Local Shared
  Objects or "LSOs") to collect and store information about your use of
  our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.</p>

  <h3 id="does-{{ ucwords($data['name']) }}-use-advertising-cookies">DOES {{ ucwords($data['name']) }} USE ADVERTISING COOKIES?</h3>

  <p>{{ ucwords($data['name']) }} uses third party service providers to display advertising on
  our Services and serve advertising on other third party sites that are
  more relevant to you or your interests. They are also used to limit the
  number of times you see an advertisement, as well as help measure the
  effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have
  visited a website and this information may be shared with other
  organizations, such as advertisers. This means that after you have been
  to our websites, you may see some advertisements about our Services
  elsewhere on the Internet. The information collected through this
  process by the third party service providers does not enable us or them
  to identify your name, contact details or other personal information
  that directly identifies you unless you choose to provide these. Such
  advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable law.</p>

  <h3 id="how-to-manage-cookies-similar-technologies-and-targeted-online-mobile-advertising">HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES, SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AND TARGETED ONLINE MOBILE ADVERTISING</h3>

  <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept cookies. You can exercise
  your preferences in relation to cookies served on our Sites by taking
  the steps outlined below.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Our Cookies (or, "First-Party Cookies").</strong> You can use the browser
  with which you are viewing this website to enable, disable or delete
  cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser
  (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings).
  Please note, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not
  be able to access secure areas of the Site. Also, if you disable
  cookies other parts of the Services may not work properly. You can
  find more information about how to change your browser cookie settings
  at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org"><em>http://www.allaboutcookies.org</em></a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Mobile Advertising:</strong> You can opt out of having your mobile
  advertising identifiers used for certain types of advertising by
  accessing the settings in mobile device and following the
  instructions. If you opt-out, we will remove all data about you and
  will not collect any further data. The random ID previously assigned
  to you will be removed. Thus, if at a later stage, you decide to
  opt-in, we will be unable to continue and track you using the prior ID
  and you will for all practical purposes be a new user.</p>

  <p><strong>Third-Party Cookies.</strong> To opt-out of third-party advertising
  networks and similar entities that use targeting/advertising cookies,
  go to
  <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices"><em>http://www.aboutads.info/choices</em></a>.
  Once you click the link, you may choose to opt-out of such advertising
  from all participating advertising companies or only advertising
  provided by specific advertising entities. For more information about
  third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these
  technologies, please see
  <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers"><em>http://www.aboutads.info/consumers</em></a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong>: Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer,
  Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track"
  or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not
  been adopted, our Sites do not currently process or respond to "DNT"
  signals.</p>

  <p><strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your
  computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block
  Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the website storage
  settings panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the
  global storage settings panel and following the instructions. Setting
  the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may
  reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications,
  including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our
  services or online content.</p>

  <h3 id="will-this-cookie-policy-be-updated">WILL THIS COOKIE POLICY BE UPDATED?</h3>

  <p>We may update this Cookie Notice from time to time to reflect, for
  example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal
  or regulatory reasons. If we do, you will be notified when you first
  visit our website after the change. You can also revisit this page if
